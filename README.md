#### This is an application I developed for smartphones, smart glasses, laptops, and desktop computers
#### C# code I wrote in 2017
#### The app reads the weather forecast for the area the phone or iPad is pointed at and overlays on the phone screen icons for the sun, rain, wind, etc., with the air temperature and other metrics in real time
